# Essay-Analyzer
This is a web based application, which identifies the misspelled words which a user might have written while writing an essay. 
Thus it can improve the speed and accuracy of writing essays.
This was submitted as a part of the final project for the course ["Inroduction to Computer Science"(CS50)](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) by HarvardX.
It includes a basic user interface for user sign-up and user login.
For storing the user account information I have used SQLite as the default database.
For the front end I have used HTML, CSS and JINJA (a templating language).
For the back end I have used Python. I have also used a web framework called Flask.
This application is not deployed on any server. 
However, I have executed this application on cloud9 (CS50 IDE) webserver and the demo of the same can be found in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYpJicBOlOU&t=1s).
Any suggestions and improvements are welcomed.
