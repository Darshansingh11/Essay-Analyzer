# Essay-Analyzer
This is a web based application, which identifies the misspelled words which a user may have written while writing an essay. 
Thus it can improve the speed and accuracy of writing essays.
This was also submitted as the final project for a course called "Inroduction to Computer Science"(CS50) by HarvardX.
It includes a basic user interface for user sign-up and user login.
For storing the user account information I have used SQLite as the default database.
For the front end I have used HTML, CSS and JINJA (a templating language).
For the back end I have used Python. I also used a web framework called Flask.
This website is not hosted on any of the servers. 
However, I have executed this program on cloud9 (CS50 IDE) webserver and the demo of the same can be found in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYpJicBOlOU&t=1s .
Any suggestions and improvements are welcomed.
Thank you.
